# flashcards

The goal of this project was to create a Flashcards Project. I first completed it in Vanilla JS and chose Vue.js as a frontend framework.

## Requirements

You are required to develop a flash cards app with the following features:

    Pre-defined flashcards with questions and answers

    Progress bar to show the user's progress

    Ability to view flashcards one at a time and flip to reveal the answer

    Simple navigation to cycle through the flashcards

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue (Official)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Recommended Browser Setup

- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.):
  - [Vue.js devtools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd)
  - [Turn on Custom Object Formatter in Chrome DevTools](http://bit.ly/object-formatters)
